# Standard Library Reference

The Standard Library is a collection of functions and packs that are available to all QINP programs and are essential to the language.

All files building the Standard Library can be found in the [stdlib](../../stdlib/):
 - [./std.qnp](./std-qnp.md)
 - [./linux/std.qnp](./linux/std-qnp.md)
 - [./linux/syscall.qnp](./linux/syscall-qnp.md)

The main file for the Standard Library is [./std.qnp](./std-qnp.md). It consists of the most fundamental functions, definitions and packs.

Every Function/pack defined in the stdlib exists in the `std` space.
