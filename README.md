# QINP

QINP is a statically typed, procedural programming language which is inspired by the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming languages.

!!! The language is a work in progress and therefore not yet stable and may be subject to breaking changes !!!

At the moment only the x86_64 Linux platform is supported.
