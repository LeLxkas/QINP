# QINP

QINP is a statically typed, procedural programming language which is inspired by the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming languages.

!!! The language is a work in progress and therefore not yet stable and may be subject to breaking changes !!!

At the moment only Linux (full) and Windows (partial) are supported (both x86_64).

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to build QINP can be found [here](./docs/home.md#getting-started).

A good starting point to get to know the QINP language are the [examples](./examples/) and the [tests](./tests/).

## Documentation

An overview of the documentation can be found [here](./docs/home.md).

All documentation related files are located in the [./docs/](./docs/) directory.
